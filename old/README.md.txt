Have a fun time texting


VERSION 1.4.5

DMs will come out in version 1.5.0

this version has some expeimental fetures/incomplete fetures



known bugs include:

your socket id changes every time you connect to the server, so if you sign in twice you can only use the most recent sign in.

if you get disconnected from the server, reload.
